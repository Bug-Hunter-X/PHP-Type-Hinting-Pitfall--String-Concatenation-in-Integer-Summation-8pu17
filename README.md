This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to type hinting and unexpected string concatenation within a function designed to sum integers. The `calculateSum` function is type hinted to accept an array of integers, but it does not explicitly handle the case of a string element within the array.  The solution shows how to address this using strict type checking or a more robust type handling approach.
